This site holds all the documentation I started writing for my home lab [breadNET](https://breadnet.co.uk/?mtm_campaign=documentation&mtm_kwd=mainpage).
It's since expanded in to my general second brain on documentation, and tricks for things.

This site gets updated [on average, once a day](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/graphs/commit-activity) and there's an accurate XML sitemap should you wish to use that in your indexing.

* [Sitemap](https://documentation.breadnet.co.uk/sitemap.xml)
* [Pages API](https://documentation.breadnet.co.uk/api/pages.json) - This is a work in progress to deliver Matrix messages to me when a page becomes outdated

I used to host this documentation on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/77be3c3aa96c) using Bookstack, however it's since been migrated to [fly.io](https://fly.io) and uses mkdocs

## A note about privacy

I have done everything I possibly can to reduce the number of trackers on this site. In theory there should be at maximim: 2

Umami or something related, and Matomo. Both of these are self-hosted and run on my home cluster. I dislike cookie banners and trackers as much as the next; which is why you won't ever see them here.

## My promise to you

This is more of a gentleman's agreement, however I make the below to you;

* No URL you've ever linked to will result in a 404 - if it does, contact me. I will fix it!
* No AI is used to write documentation
* The Documentation source code will always remain source available in git (Currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk))
* [If you open an issue on the repo](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/issues), I will look at it and try to fix your issue/ help you

## Feedback?

This is a personal project, I don't have adverts on this site and any of my other sites, and it costs me money and time to build and run this.
All I ask from you is feedback on pages. If you spot something wrong, [please open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/issues) or email me using the email icon at the bottom of every page.
