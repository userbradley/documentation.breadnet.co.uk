This site holds all the documentation I started writing for my home lab [breadNET](https://breadnet.co.uk/?mtm_campaign=documentation&mtm_kwd=mainpage) and then
branched out to all IT documentation I wrote


This site gets updated [on average, once a day](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/graphs/commit-activity)

This site used to be hosted on Digital Ocean and using Bookstack, but found the greener grass of mkdocs. Simply write markdown
and edit a yaml file, and you're good to go
