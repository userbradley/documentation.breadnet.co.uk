This site holds all the documentation I started writing for my home lab [breadNET](https://breadnet.co.uk/?mtm_campaign=documentation&mtm_kwd=mainpage).
It has since expanded to include all the IT documentation I've written, covering a wide range of topics from home networking to cloud computing.

This site gets updated [on average, once a day](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/graphs/commit-activity), so check back often for new content!

I used to host this documentation on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/77be3c3aa96c) using Bookstack, but I've since migrated to the simplicity of mkdocs.

**Here's a taste of what you'll find:**

* **Home Lab Documentation:** Detailed guides on my network infrastructure, software configurations, and hardware setup.
* **Cloud and Kubernetes:** Notes and tutorials on cloud platforms, Kubernetes deployments, and related technologies like Terraform and Helm.
* **Software Guides:**  Instructions for various software tools and services, including SSH, Zerotier, and self-hosted analytics.
* **And yes, even Bread Baking!**  Because everyone needs a hobby outside of tech.

**Explore the documentation now!**
