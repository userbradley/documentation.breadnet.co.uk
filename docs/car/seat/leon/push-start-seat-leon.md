title: How to push start a SEAT leon
---

## Why

When your battery dies, sometimes you don't have the luxury of nice insurance that has break down cover,
or you have the AA who take ages to come get you - But you know it's the battery that has given up.

You are able to push the car to start it

## How

!!! danger "Be careful"
    You are pushing the car with no power steering or power assisted breaking.
    
    I accept **no** responsibility for what you do

    There are cases of people who have run them selves (or others) over

Both set of instructions to follow assume you have turned your car on. This is the position on the key that is before the starter engages


=== "With a Friend"

    1. Have your friend stand at the back of the car. Agree that when you shout "Stop pushing" they are to **immediately** stop pushing
    and let go of the car
    2. Engage the clutch and put the car in second gear. Keep the clutch in
    3. Have your friend push the car to about 10mph (16 kmh)
    4. Shout "Stop pushing"
    5. Release the clutch past the biting point, so it's engaged with the flywheel, and you should feel the car jolt and the RPM gauge show the engine running.
    6. Push your clutch back in. Put the car in Neutral and engage the parking break. 


=== "Without a friend"

    Firstly, sorry mate. Good luck, this one is not going to be fun
    
    1. Use your seatbelt like a lead for your car. Extend it and lock it (pull sharply)
    2. Use it to pull your car up to the speed of about 15mph 
    3. Jump in to the car
    4. Put the clutch in fully (Do not take your foot off until told to)
    5. Put the gear selector in second gear
    6. Release the clutch past the biting point, so it's engaged with the flywheel, and you should feel the car jolt and the RPM gauge show the engine running.
    7. Push your clutch back in. Put the car in Neutral and engage the parking break.
