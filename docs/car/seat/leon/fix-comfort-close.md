title: Fix comfort close not working on Seat Leon
---

## How do I know it's broken

After your car battery runs out, or you replace the battery, comfort close will not work.

A sign of this is when you go to use comfort close (pull the window button all the way up) it does not close fully

## How to fix this

!!! note "Repeat for each window"
    The below steps need to be repeated for each window

1. Open window fully, and hold the button down for 2 seconds
2. let go of the button for half a second (this timing is not accurate)
3. hold down the button for 2 seconds in the open position
4. Close the window and hod the button for 2 seconds once the window is closed
5. Let go of the button for half a second (this timing is not accurate)
6. Hold the button up for another 2 seconds (You will hear the window click)

Once this is done, it should be fixed. Repeat for each additional window you have in your car
