# Workload Identity test pod

## Why

Sometimes you need to run a simple pod on the cluster to check things, call a service or run commands

## Things to note

You will need to have the `compute metadata api` service running in the cluster


## How

=== "KSA"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: workload-identity-test
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: google/cloud-sdk:slim
          name: workload-identity-test
          command: ["sleep","infinity"]
      serviceAccountName: <>
    ```

=== "GKE Workload nodes"

    !!! Note
        Sometimes your may have nodes in a pool that don't have the metadata server enabled.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: workload-identity-test
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: google/cloud-sdk:slim
          name: workload-identity-test
          command: ["sleep","infinity"]
      serviceAccountName: <>
      nodeSelector:
        iam.gke.io/gke-metadata-server-enabled: "true"
    ```
