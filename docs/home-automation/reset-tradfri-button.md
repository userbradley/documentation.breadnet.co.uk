title: Reset tradfri button
---

To reset the tradfri button, unscrew the cover exposing the battery

Ensure the battery has sufficient charge, I recommend whilst the cover is off, to replace the battery anyway.

There is a button on the rear, with a `chain` icon. Click this button **4 times** in quick succession. It must be quick successions.

Below shows the image of the button with the rear removed and battery port exposed

It will take around 20 seconds. DO NOT REMOVE THE BATTERY

The button will immediately go in to pairing mode, so any Zigbee coordinators in paring wil pick it up.
