## Hello

You have most likely followed a link from Bookstack, my old documentation site.

This is the new site for all documentation.

I have done my best to preserve the directory structure from Bookstack, but some pages have new homes.

## Redirects

All the content pages are set up to redirect to their new homes.

You can have a look at the redirects [Here](https://github.com/userbradley/documentation.breadnet.co.uk/blob/master/redirect.conf)

## Chapters

Bookstack had the below structure for pages

```text
.
└── bookstack
    └── book
        └── chapter
            └── page

```

An example of this would be for the page `VPN Network routing Mikrotik`

Its URL is `https://bookstack.breadnet.co.uk/books/kb-articles/page/vpn-network-routing-mikrotik` <!-- Leave this here, it's an example of what a new link would be like when the redirect happens -->

And if we were to visualize the directory it would be:

```
└── bookstack
    └── KB Artickes
        └── Networking
            └── VPN Network routing Mikrotik

```

I am not redirecting from the section "KB Articles" - Only the pages as no one other than my self will be linking to chapters.

## Missing pages you and your team relied on

If you or your team relied on a page, please drop me an email and I will crack it out the archive store for you!
