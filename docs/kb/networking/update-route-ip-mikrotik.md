title: Update the To Address on Mikrotik VPN Routing

# Update the To Address on Mikrotik VPN Routing

## Why

Due to how the VPN is set up, the TLS will re-negotiate every 24 hours.

This means that once every 24 hours the connection will drop.

## How do I know the connection has dropped

You will have no internet

## How to resolve it

### Connect to the router

!!! note "Use another device for this"
    Due to how the network is set up, you cant use a device on the VPN network to access the router

=== "Winbox"

    Search for `Winbox` on your computer.

    Type in the IP address of the router

    Type in the password

    Click `Connect`


=== "Website"

    Navigate to the Router's IP address

    Type in your username and password

    Click `Login`

### Locate the new IP address

=== "Winbox"

    Click `IP` then `Address`

    Make note of the IP address of the VPN tunnel. It will probably be called `London`

    In our example, the IP address is `172.27.232.9`

    (_nb: this is an old screenshot, just use your imagination_)
