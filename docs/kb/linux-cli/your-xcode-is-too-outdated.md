# Your Xcode is too outdated.

## Why

This is an error that comes up after a major upgrade

You will see the below error


```text
Error: Your Xcode (14.0.1) is too outdated.
Please update to Xcode 14.1 (or delete it).
Xcode can be updated from the App Store.

Error: Your Command Line Tools (CLT) does not support macOS 13.
It is either outdated or was modified.
Please update your Command Line Tools (CLT) or delete it if no updates are available.
Update them from Software Update in System Preferences.

If that doesn't show you any updates, run:
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install

Alternatively, manually download them from:
  https://developer.apple.com/download/all/.
You should download the Command Line Tools for Xcode 14.1.
```

## How to fix

### System Preferences

??? note "What to do if there's no updates"
    Continue to [Command line fix](#command-line-fix)

1. Open System preferences on the Mac
2. Go to `Software update`
3. Check for Updates
4. Install Updates


### Command Line fix

### Update Command line tools for xcode

Open terminal

```shell
 softwareupdate --list
```

This should _hoprefully_ show the below

```text
âžœ softwareupdate --list

```

Upgrade it with:

## Still not working

If it's still not working, move `xcode` to trash, reboot and re-install it

## Possible side effects

### XCRUN
