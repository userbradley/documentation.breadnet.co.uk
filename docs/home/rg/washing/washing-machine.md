### Status lights


#### Time left on a wash

This function is useless, as the `3h` light will always be lit up.

To work out when the machine is done, you can wait until the machine beeps, and you hear two `Tick` noises.


#### Hour lights

When using the delay mode, the lights will light up in order of `3h` to `9h`


### Setting a delay

We use this mode if we are starting the machine during the night, and do not wish to be woken up as the machines works.

Know the rough time you want the washing to go off. By default, I have the machine go off at `6am` roughly, as this
allows me enough time to wake up and hang the clothing up before the clothe smell

Press the `Time delay` and the `3h` light will come on.

Press the `Time delay` button again, and the `6h` button will come on.

Pressing the button each time will increment it, setting the time from `now`

??? Note "Foreign washing machines"
    As this machine is made for the domestic market, it's internal clock will be set to `50hz`, however the grid fluctuates,
    so setting 3 hours can be within +/- 25 minutes

### Spin

Sometimes if we are washing large loads of clothing the machine may not spin enough to remove most of the water content

We are able to request a second spin cycle.

2. Set the `Selector knob` to `15`
3. Press the :play_pause: button

The cycle is completed when the machine unlocks

### Drying

You can set the machine to either _add a drying cycle_ to the end of a wash, or dry as a seperate function

!!! warning "About the drying mode"
    It has the potential to shrink clothing and cause increased electricity usage.


#### Dry as part of a wash

1. Select your washing mode as usual
2. Set the  `Drying Mode` button (One with the photo of an Iron, coat hanger etc.) to the desired temprature

This will add a drying cycle to the end of the wash

#### Drying independently of a wash

1. Once the wash has finished, set the _selector_ knob to anything greater than 11.
2. Refer to [Photo](#photo) for different modes
3. Select the temperature that you want to dry to be done at using the far right selector knob
4. Press start


## Troubleshooting

### Door is not opening

This can happen when the machine is in a failed state.

!!! warning "Do not force the door open"
    Doing so can cause the machine to break.

Once the cycle has finished, the machine will beep. This is loud enough to hear from anywhere in the apartment.

If the door does not open immediately, wait 3-10 minutes till you hear `2` clicks. These are not as loud, but are not a common noise - so you will hear it

1. If the door does not open still, power the machine off using the switch on the right hand side wall visibly labelled `Washing Machine`
It's the second switch in from the light switch.

2. Wait 3-5 minutes and power the machine back on
3. Wait 3-5 minutes
4. Try and open the door

#### Door continues to fail to open

Please contact the management company for the apartment.
