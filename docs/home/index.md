It's hard to write and categorise documentation for your home when you

1. Have all your documentation public and don't want to leak your home address
2. Rent and move once every 2 years but don't want to _dead link_ anything

I have come up with a clever system for this

Each _location_ is made up of the first 2 letters of the post code.

Ideally I won't be moving within the same postcode, but if that happens, then it would become like the below:

```text
 * ------ First 2 letters of postcode
 | * ---- End letters of the postcode
 | |
cb-yy
```
