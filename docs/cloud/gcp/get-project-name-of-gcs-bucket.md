# Get project name of GCS bucket

## Why

Sometimes when you are managing many [GCS buckets ](https://cloud.google.com/storage) - You may lose the project they exist in.

If you aren't using a swanky naming convention like `<proj-name>-<name>` then this is for you.

## How

We are able to use the [GCS API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api) to get information about the bucket.

!!! note "Required permissions"
    As this is using the GCP API, you will have to at least have the below permissions/roles

    * `storage.buckets.get`
    * `storage.buckets.list`
    * View access on the project

### Get project Number

```shell
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/<>" | jq ."projectNumber"
```
### Convert number to project name

```shell
gcloud projects describe --format json | jq .name
```


## Example

```shell
# Get the project number
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/kubernetes-release" | jq ."projectNumber"
```

```shell
# Get the project Name
gcloud projects describe 255964991331 --format json | jq .name
```
