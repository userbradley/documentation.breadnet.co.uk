title: Get User info from Numerical Google account ID
---

## What

In google cloud, there are some systems (namely composer) that display users by their Numerical ID in logs

![composer numerical ID](../../assets/composer-owner-numerical.png)

??? note "Redacted ID's"
    All the ID's have been changed from their original ones so no use trying to use this

This is made up of the below

```text
          * ------------------------ Accounts Domain
          |              * -------- Numerical Identifier
          |              |
accounts.google.com:114108529276530960947
```

If anyone ever finds the Documentation on how these are made, or what the field names are, please get in contact

## Get user email address from ID

Navigate to Googles [Method: people.get](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people/get) API Playground

On the right hand side will be a `Try this method` Tab

![Google API try this method](../../assets/google-api-try-this-method.png)


Below details what to put in each field

| Field name     | Value                                              | Example                                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `resourceName` | `people/<numerical ID`                             | `people/114108529276530960947`                     |
| `personFields` | `emailAddresses,externalIds,locations,memberships` | `emailAddresses,externalIds,locations,memberships` |


Note: The `resourceName` field will continue to have a red banner next to it

The page will now look like the below
