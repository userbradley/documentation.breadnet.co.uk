# Get the Real IP address from fly when behind cloudflare

!!! warning "A note on this KB"
    You should only use this page if you are using *both* cloudflare *proxy* and fly.io

## Why

It's not really needed too much on the Fly side, it's more _a nice to have_.

We have this _issue_ when you put an instance behind Cloudflare and enable the proxy, you don't get the Real IP address of the
device connecting, you get the Cloudflare exit node IP

```shell

```

## Solution

You will need to navigate to both the links below and grab the up-to-date IP's

* [CF V4](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4)
* [CF V6](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6)

Once located, create a new file and put the IP's in the below format

```shell
set_real_ip_from 173.245.48.0/20;
```

At the top of the file, add the below

```shell
real_ip_recursive on;
real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;

## Fly Internal IP
set_real_ip_from 172.19.0.0/16;
```
