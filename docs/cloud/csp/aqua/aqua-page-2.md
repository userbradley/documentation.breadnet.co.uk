Secrets need to be added as an env variable, image needs tags

    spec:
          containers:
          - env:
            - name: bradley

Module 9: Serverless
--------------------

GCP is supported when scanning before run

Only AWS supports runtime protection

How it protects:

*   Secures serverless functions at run time
*   Runtime assurance
    *   Nano-enforcer allows Aqua to carry out runtime protection
    *   Does not work for GCP

--------------------------------

*   Aquactl can be used to inject nano-enforcers as well as
*   Download Manifests 

Module 12: Aqua for dev

*   Evaluation:
*   Make use of opensource tools

Validation

*   Check audit/ci
*   check running containers
*   Check risk explorer to get high level overviews
