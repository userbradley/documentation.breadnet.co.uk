## What was affected

* K3s Cluster On premise
* Internal Tooling

## What caused it

For some reason I cant locate the logs for, the BT router decided that the control plane node's IP address is `172.16.3.154`

And for another reason, the Router (default from ISP) re-addressed the other nodes, somehow putting the node `k3s-02` at the IP
address `172.16.0.1` (Which is the IP address of the DNS k8s svc)

I manually changed the IP address of the main node using netplan with the below config

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp2s0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [172.16.2.1]
      gateway4: 172.16.3.254
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]
```

This then caused the k3s cluster to pick up the default route IP address which is now `172.16.2.1`, opposed to the IP address
specified by the `tls-san` and `bind-address`

> It's not eth0, the kubelet picks the interface with the default route. This is standard Kubernetes behavior.

This then caused the below error

```

```

Which then in turn meant that other nodes could not connect to the control plane.

I then decided that the easiest way to resolve this issue is to wipe the cluster and start again.



## What monitoring was in place

* None

## What was done to resolve it

I made the call after not really understanding the issue at hand to wipe the cluster, reinstall it all and re-connect flux

This took around 20 minutes

## What did we learn

I could have added the below lines to the `config.yaml` file, and it would have fixed things

```yaml
node-external-ip: 172.16.2.0
node-ip: 172.16.2.0
```

This would have told k3s to use the ip address `172.16.2.0` (vrrp address) opposed to the IP address attached to the network
card with the default route


I also learnt that I need to stop putting off the Juniper router migration as this could have been avoided quite easily
