# CKA

This seems like it will be by far the hardest exam and learning of my career.

## How I plan to attack it

1. Online Courses
2. Purchase an SFF computer and build a cluster using kubeadm and the [hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/tree/master/docs)
3. Break down the cluster and do it again, this time make notes and a run book
4. Have someone break it
5. Fix it
6. Do it all again
7. Build more documentation on K8's

Hopefully this should take no longer than a year to complete, balancing it alongside work
