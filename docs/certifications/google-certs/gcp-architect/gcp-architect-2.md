#### IAM

*   Resources
    *   Humans
    *   Non-humans
*   Identities can be:
    *   Users
    *   Groups
    *   Application running in GCP
    *   Application running in your Datacentre
    *   Unauthenticated users
*   Granular control
    *   Limit a singular user
        *   Perform actions
        *   On a specific cloud resource
        *   From a specific IP address
        *   During a specific time

##### IAM: Example

*   Want to provide access for a colleague to specific cloud bucket
    *   Important generic concepts
        *   Member: My Colleague
        *   Resources: Specific cloud storage bucket
        *   Action: Upload/ Delete objects
    *   In google cloud IAM
        *   Roles: Set of permissions
            *   Roles do not know about members
        *   How do you assign permissions to a member:
            *   Policy: You assign (Or bind) a role to a member
*   Choose a role with the right permissions
*   Create a Policy binding the members with the role

##### IAM: Roles

*   Roles are permissions
    *   Perform some set of actions on some set of resources
*   3 types
    *   basic roles: (or primitive roles)
        *   Viewers (roles.viewer) read only access
        *   Editor (roles.editor) Viewer and edit action
        *   Owner (roles.owner) Editor + manage roles and permissions + Billing
        *   Not recommended: Don't use in prod
    *   Predefined rules - fine-grained riles predefined and managed by google
    *   Custom roles - when pre-defined roles are not sufficient 
*   If creating a role, ensure you give it a good ID
*   There are also role versions to use, so:
    *   Alpha, beta, General availability, Disabled
*   Most of the roles will give you:
    *   resourcemanager.projects.get
    *   resourcemanager.projects.list

##### IAM - Most important concepts 

*   You create a role which contains the permissions
*   You bind the role to a user with a policy

##### IAM - Service accounts

*   An application needs to auth with something on the GCP platform
*   You **do not want to** use an actual account for this, so you use a service account
*   Identifiable via email:
    *   Does not have a password
    *   Has a private/public rsa key
    *   cant login via browser or cookies
*   Service account types
    *   Default service account - Not recommended to use
    *   User managed - User created
        *   Provides fine-grained access control
*   Add roles to the service account if you're backing up to GCS
*   You cannot assign a service account to an on-prem application
*   This is called long-lived 
    1.  Create service account with right permissions
2.  Create service account user managed keu
    1.  gcloud iam service-accounts keys create
3.  Make the service account key accessable by your application
    1.  ENV variable should be: GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS
4.  use google cloud client libraries - ADC (Application default credentials)
*   Short-lived:
    *   Few hours of access
    *   Credential types:
        *   Oauth2
        *   OpenID Connect ID tokens
            *   Service to service authentication for short periods of time
        *   Self signed json web tokens

##### IAM Best Practices

*   Principle of least privelage
    *   Give the least possible privelage needed for a role
*   Use service accoutns with Minimum privelages
*   Seperation of Duties
    *   Involve at least 2 people
        *   Have seperate traffic deployer and traffic migrator roles
        *   Breaks up issues from one person not seeing something 
*   Constant monitoring
    *   Always view the logs and see who is accessing your service account
    *   Ensure audit logs are archived 
*   Use groups when ever possible
    *   Bind roles to groups
    *   Just add a new user to the group

##### Understanding Identity managment

*   Email used = Super Admin
*   Google Workspace
    *   If you use workspace, you can link them and manage groups from there
*   Not using Workspace
    *   You can link your identity provider
        *   Federate google cloud with your identity provier
*   Fererate
    *   You want to auth with your external idP (Identity provider)
    *   Example isActive directory
    *   We can 'Federate' cloud identity 
*   Example:
    *   Federate AD with GCDS then ADFS

##### Corporate directory federation

*   Federate identity provider with your external IDP
*   Enable SSO
    *   Users go to google cloud
    *   Redirected to external IDP
    *   Users sign in
    *   SAML assertion is sent to GCP

##### Iam Members/ Identities

*   Google account
*   Service account
*   Google group
    *   Unique email adress
    *   Manage permissions in one place
*   Workspace Domain
*   Cloud Identity as a service (IDaaS)

##### ACL - Access control list

*   Access Control Lists define who has access to your buckets and objects
*   How is this different from IAM?
    *   IAM permissions apply to all objects in a bucket
    *   ACL's can be used to customize specific access to different objects
*   Users get access if they are allowed by either IAM or ACL
*   Use IAM for permissions to the whole bucket (Uniform access)
*   ACL for access to individual objects
*   Buckets have 2 levels:
    *   Fine-grained
        *   Per object access
    *   Uniform
        *   NO object level ACL

##### Signed URL

*   Allow users to access the objects for a short period of time
*   No login required
*   Create a signed URL with a service account with the desired permissions, then create a key for that URL, and assign it to the signed URL
    `gsutil signurl -d <number>m <key> gs://<bucket>/<object path>`

#### Web servies

##### Expose static site using cloud storage

1.  Create a bucket with the same dns name as your site
    1.  Verify that you own it
2.  Copy files to the bucket
3.  Set uniform access to the bucket
    1.  Set to \`All Users\`
    2.  grant view all objects

#### Databases

##### Fundamentals

*   Databases provice organized and Persistent storage for your data
*   To choose between different databse types we would need to understand:
    *   Availability
    *   Durability
    *   RTO
    *   RPO
    *   Consistency
    *   transactions

##### Availability and Durability

*   ##### Availability 

    *   Will I be able to access my data when I need it
    *   Percentage of the time an application provides operations
*   ##### Durability

    *   Will my data be available in x years
*   What does durability mean?
    *   Not losing data
*   How to increase it
    *   Replicate the data 
    *   Ensure sonsistency 

##### RTO & RPO

*   RTO
    *   Recovery time objective
        *   Maximum acceptable downtime
*   RPO
    *   Recovery point objective
        *   Maximum acceptable period of data loss

##### Read Replicas

If you have an application that has high reads, you can create a read replica

If there is a master failure you can promote one of the slaves to master

##### Consistency

*   Strong consistency
    *   Synchronized to all replicas
        *   Transaction will slow down if you have alot of replicas
*   Eventual constancy
    *   A little lag between replication
    *   Used when scalability is more important than data integrity
*   Read after write consisteny 
    *   Inserts are immediately available in all replicas
*   Updates are doe via eventual consistency 

##### Categories 

*   Relational 
    *   OLTP
    *   Online transaction processing
*   OLAP
    *   Online analytics processing
*   Document
*   Key value
*   Graph
*   In memory

*   Factors
    *   Do you want a fixed recovery?
    *   Transaction properties (Atomicity and consistency)
    *   Latency
    *   Transactions p/s
    *   Data stored

##### Relational Databases

*   This was the only option a while back
*   Predefined schemas
*   Strong transactional capabilities 

##### GCP Databases

*   OLTP
    *   Applications where users make lots of small transactions (updates etc.)
    *   Popular:
        *   Mysql
        *   Oracle 
        *   SQL server
    *   Recommended managed service:
        *   CloudSQL
        *   CloudSpanner
            *   Unlimited scale and global scale
*   OLP
    *   Running analytics
        *   Datawarehouse
    *   BigQuery

Difference between OLTP and OLAP

*   OLTP
    *   Databases use rows
    *   Each table row is stored together
    *   Efficient for small transactions
*   OLAP
    *   Each table column in stored together
    *   High Compression
    *   Distribute data easily
    *   Execute query across multiple nodes


##### NoSql

*   New approach
*   NoSQL = Not only SQL
*   Flexible schema
    *   Lets the schema evolve with the data
*   Horozontal schale to petabytes 
*   Typical nosql has scability and high performance
*   Products
    *   Cloud Firestore
        *   Serverless
        *   Document storage storage
        *   ACID
        *   Firestore has SDK's
        *   Small to medium
    *   CloudBigtable
        *   Scalable
        *   Managed
        *   recommended for data greater than 10tb to petabytes
            *   Not reccomended for transactional 
            *   No support for multi-row transactions
        *   Reccomened for:
            *   Large streams of data

##### In memory databases

*   In memory stored database
*   Retreival is faster
*   Service:
    *   Memory Store

##### Designing BigTable tables

*   What data do you want to store
*   What would your frequent used queries look like?
*   Design your key/value store
    *   Each table only has one index
    *   You can store multiple key segments, separated by a deliminator 
*   If you frequently search recent data
    *   Start backwards so most recent data is first

##### Best practices

*   Recommended for streaming IOT and Time Series
*   Automatically shards data in to multiple tablets
*   Tablets are distributed accross different nodes
    *   Goals:
        *   Same amount of data on each node
        *   Distribute reads and writes equally

    *   Stored data indiepndantly 
    *   Store the data closer to the users
    *   Configure an app policy with routing

### Networking

#### VPC

*   VPC
    *   Can contain many subnets
    *   Regional
*   Subnets
    *   To close off things from public you use a subnet
    *   You have 2 subnets
        *   Private
            *   Nothing here can be access from the internet
        *   Public
*   Creating a VPC
    *   Option 1: Auto Mode
        *   Subnets are created in each region
        *   Default VPC created automatically
    *   Option 2: Custom mode VPC
        *   No subnets are created
        *   You have complete control over subnets and their IP ranges
        *   Prod recommendation

        *   0: Highest
        *   65535: Lowest
    *   ##### Default rule:

        *   Egress allowed
        *   Deny Ingress
*   Default VPC
    *   the default VPC has 4 default rules with the priority 65534
        *   Called fefault-allow-internal
*   Ingress rules:
    *   Target: Defines the destination
        *   Targeting it: Service account or tag
    *   Source: 
        *   Defines where the traffic is coming from
        *   Targeting it: Tags or Service accont
    *   Each rule:
        *   Priority
        *   Action on match
            *   Allow or deny

### Organizing GCP Cloud Resources

#### Resource Hierarchy

*   Well defined hierarchy
    *   Organization > Folder > Project > Resources
*   Resources are created in Projects
*   A folder can contain multiple projects
*   An organization can contain multiple folders

[![image-1621095512411.png](/assets/nWVeT4OzIa1ANMPb-image-1621095512411.png)](/assets/nWVeT4OzIa1ANMPb-image-1621095512411.png)

#### Recommendations for Enterprises

*   Create separate projects for different environments
    *   Complete isolation
*   Separate folder for each environment
    *   Isolate environments from one department
    *   Create a shared folder for shared resources
*   One project per application per environment
    *   App1 and app2
    *   dev and prod
    *   Projects:
        *   A1-DEV
        *   A1-PROD
        *   A2-DEV
        *   A2-PROD

#### Billing accounts

*   Billing account is mandatory
*   Every project has one billing account
*   You can have multiple billing accounts in one organization
*   Create billing accounts representing your organization 
*   two types of accounts
    *   Self serve: Billed directly
    *   Invoiced: Invoice is created and sent to accounts 

#### Managing billing

##### Budget

*   Should set up an alert
*   Default threshold is at 50, 90 and 100%
*   Can send ti:
    *   Email
    *   Pub/sub
*   Billing data can be exported to:
    *   Big query
    *   File export (Now depricated) 

#### Organization Policy Service

*   Centralized constraints on all resources
    *   Configure an organization policy
    *   Needs organization policy role
*   IAM focues on WHO
*   Organizatin policy focuses on WHAT

### Linux stuff

#### SSH to VM

*   Compute engine uses Key based auth
*   two options:
    *   Metadata managed:
        *   Manually create and configure individual ssh keys
        *   OS Login: Manage ssh without managing individual ssh keys
            *   Your Linux account is automatically linked to your cloud identity
            *   Go to metadata and set:
                *   enable-oslogin to true
            *   Users need to have roles:
                *   Roled/compute.osLogin
                *   roles/compute.osAdminLogin
            *   Windows: Password
            *   Linux: Keybased

#### Execute a shutdown script

*   Can be used on pre-emptible and non-preemptible VM's
*   Runs as:
    *   Root on linux
    *   System on windows
*   Stored as metadata
    *   key: shutdown-script
    *   value: Script
    *   \--metadata-from-file shutdown-script=script.sh from cli
    *   Can store the scripts in cloud storage
*   Run on best effort:
    *   Not if you do a reset
    *   Wont run if exceeding grace period

#### Troubleshoot VM startup

*   Are there quota errors?
*   Boot disk full?
*   Serial port 
    *   Each vm has 4 serial ports
*   Serial port output: OS, Bios, Other system level entites
*   can access it from cloud console, compute engine api and gcloud cli
*   Can send this to cloud logging
*   metadata:
    *   serial-port-logging-enabled = true
*   command
    *   gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output
*   Valid file system
    *   attach that disk to another vm and see if you can access files

#### Moving instances between zones and regions

*   Can be moved between zones in the same region
    *   gcloud compute instances move <name> --zone <zone active> --destination-zone <destination>
    *   Cant move a MIG
    *   Cant do with local SSD
    *   Not terminated instances
    *   Not across regions
*   Manual approach
    *   Snapshot PD's
    *   create copy of PD's in new region
    *    Pub/Sub

### Pub/Sub

#### Synchronous communication

*   Example:
    *   Application on your web server make synchronous calls to the logging service
    *   What if the logging service goes down?
*   Solution:
    *   Create a topic and put the logs on it
    *   logging service picks them up when it's ready
    *   Advantages:
        *   Decouple apps 
        *   Availability: Publisher remains up
        *   Scalability 
        *   Durability: Message isn't lost if the service is down

#### Pub/Sub

*   Reliable scalable fully managed
*   Backbone for HA and scalable solutions
    *   Autoscales
    *   Low cost
*   Use cases:
    *   Event ingestion and delivery streaming
*   Support push and pull message delivery 

##### How it works

*   Publisher - Sender of a message
    *   *   Publisher sends a message by making a https request to pubsub.googlepais.com
*   Subscriber - Reciever of the message
    *   Pull 
        *   Subscriber makes the https call
    *   Push
        *   Messages are sent to subscribers
            *   Subscribers provide a web hook endpoint at the time of regestration
            *   When a message is recieved on the topic, a https post message is sent to the webhooks endpoint
*   very flexible:
    *   Publishers and subscribers, one to many, many to one, many to many

#### Getting ready with topic and subscriptions

1.  Topic is created
2.  Subscribers are created
    1.  Subscribers regisert to the topic
    2.  Each subscriber represents a discrete pull of messages
        1.  Multiple clients pull the same subscriptions 
        2.  Multiple clients create a subscription

##### Sending

*   Publisher sends a message
*   Message individually delivered to each and every subscription
*   Subscribers receive messages
    *   Push
    *   Pull
*   Subscriber acknowledges 
*   Messages are removed from subscriptions
*   Snapshot:
    *   Point in time snapshot of that subscription


#### Best practices

*   Use cases:
    *   Convert synchronous messages to asynchronous 
        *   Useful when consumers cant keep up with producer
    *   Opensources:
        *   RabbitMQ
        *   Apache Kafka
    *   Apply transformations to IOT stream
    *   Processing:
        *   In order
        *   Exactly one
        *   option --enable-message-ordering
        *   Add dataflow in to flow to enable messade dedupe (Exactly once processing)

#### Dataflow

*   Data ETL kinda?
*   Streaming batch usaceses
    *   Real time fraud preventionn
    *   Sensor data processing
    *   Log data processing
*   Prebuilt templates

### Hybrid Cloud

##### Cloud VPN

*   Cloud VPN
    *   Traffic flows over the internet
    *   Traffic encrypted using IKE (Internet key exchange)
*   2 types:
    *   HA VPN
        *   SLA of 99.99
        *   2 external IP's
        *   BGP
    *   Classic VPN
        *   SLA of 99.9
        *   Static Routing
        *   Dynamic BGP
*   Go for VPN if:
    *   Low cost
    *   Lower throughput
    *   Network to encrypt it
    *   Just started experimenting with connectivity 

##### HA VPN

*   HA VPN
    *   High Avaliblity
    *   Regional
    *   Needs a cloud HA VPN Gateway
    *   2 interfaces

##### Classic VPN

*   Classic VPN
    *   No HA
    *   Needs a Google compute engine vpn gateway

VPN Gateway - Regional resource

Cloud router enables dynamic routing: Enables automatic route update

#### Cloud Interconnect 

*   Cloud interconnect
    *   High speed 
    *   Low latency
    *   Not encrypted
*   Dedicated interconnect
    *   High bandwith 
    *   Minimum of 10gbps
    *   Options are:

        *   100gbps
        *   8x10gbps
        *   2x100gbps
    *   Can take 2-3 weeks
*   Partner Interconnect
    *   ideal if you need a lower bandwith connection 
    *   50mbps to 10gbps
    *   Data exchanged over private network
        *   Communicate using VPC network 
        *   Reduces egress costs
            *   Internet is not used

#### Hybrid Connectivity

*   Hybrid connectivity
    *   Use different IP ranges
    *   Backup?
        *   Cloud interconnect, also establish a VPN
*   Direct peering
    *   You peer to google
    *   Not a GCP Service
    *   Not reccomended
        *   Should use a GCP Service
    *   BGP routing from the datacentre 

### Data warehouse

#### Big query

*   Big Query
    *   Excabyte scale modern data warehouse
    *   Relational database (SQL Schema, cinsistency)
        *   Uses SQL like commands
    *   Organized in to Datasets
    *   Traditional (Storage + compute) + Modern (Realtime + serverless)
    *   when talking about data-warehousing:
        *   Importing and exporting is important
            *   Variety of formats:
                *   CSV, Json, Avro, Parquet, OCR, Datastore backup
            *   Export to GCS (Long term storage)
            *   Visulize (Data studio)
            *   Storing long term:
                *   Compress it
                    *   CSV/ Json
                    *   Avro
            *   Automatically expire data
                *   Configurable Table expiratoin
*   External sources
    *   Use external sources in Bigquery:
        *   Cloud SQL
        *   BigTable
        *   Google drive
*   Partitinoing
    *   We are able to partition the table by date, or some value
    *   When we do a query, only some segments are scanned
*   Cluster:
    *   Group related data
        *   Example: By category
*   Overview:
    *   Partitioning: Table is divided into segments
    *   Clustering: Grouping related data by category
*   Payment:
    *   Pay for storage
    *   Data used in the query

##### Importing Data in to BigQuery

*   Importing in to BQ
    *   Batch
        *   Free
        *   Import after processing by Cloud Dataflow and cloud Dataproc
            *   Dataproc:
                *   Managed Hadoop
    *   Stream
        *   Expensive
        *   Pub/sub
        *   Streaming Inserts
    *   BQ data transfer service
        *   Import from External:
            *   Saas
            *   S3
            *   Other Datawarehouses
    *   Federation

##### Streaming Data

*   Streaming Data
    *   Not free
    *   Lots of limitations
        *   No InsertID
            *   Can stream up to 1gb per second per project
        *   InsertID
            *   Us and EU: 500000 per second
            *   Per table: 100000
            *   Maximum bytes per secon: 100
    *   If streaming millions, use BigTable

##### Best Practices

*   Estimate:
    *   bq --dry-run
*   Cost:
    *   Expire data
    *   Load data in Bulk
*   Long term storage:
    *   When not edited for 90 days, cost goes down
*   Fast for complex queries
*   Not optimized for narrow range queries
*   Stream your audit logs from BigQuery to Bigquery
    *   View in Datastudio

        *   Persistence
*   Can be accessed from:
    *   Most of the compute services


#### AppEngine Caching 

*   Appengine caching memcached
    *   Shared Memcached (free)
    *   Dedicated:
        *   Expensive: billed by the GB hour

#### CDN

*   CDN Best practices
    *   Always cache static content
    *   Be careful with caching dynamic conent
    *   Use custom cache keys to improve cache hit ratio
        *   Any combination of host
            *   protocal
            *   host
            *   query string
    *   Versioned URL
        *   setting a version like ?v=1 and then new version is v=2, so you get a cache miss

        *   Test with production traffic
*   Best practices:
    *   Small frequent changes
    *   Automate release managemnt

#### Recreate

*   Recreate
    *   Install the new version on the new instances
    *   Most basic approach
    *   Terminate V1 and roll out V2
*   Advantage:
    *   Cost-effective and fast
    *   Less compatibility issues
*   Disadvantage:
    *   Rollback is a redeployment
    *   More downtime

#### Canary Deployment

*   Canary
    *   Roll out to a subset of instances
    *   Once metrics are okay
    *   Roll out to more
*   Characheristics
    *   Fast
    *   Zero downtime
    *   No extra infra
    *   Needs backwards compatibility

##### A/B Testing

*   A/B
    *   Set up a small new feature and test with half the users
    *   See if users like somethng

#### Rolling Approach

*   Rolling:
    *   Roll out the version of the software to 5% at a time (For example)
*   Charachterists:
    *   Slow
    *   Zero Downtime
    *   Needs automation
    *   No needed infrastrucute
    *   Less impact in a failure
*   Rolling with additional batch
    *   zero reduction in the instances that are running the old version
    *   you add in another instance whilst it runs

#### Blue Green Deployment

*   Blue-green
    *   Create a parallel environment with the new version
    *   Once all tests are done on V1, we switch to the new version
    *   As far as the end users are concerned, only one release is live
*   Characteristics
    *   Zero downtime
    *   Easy rollback
    *   Needs additional Infra
    *   Zero reduction in ability to serve
    *   Backwards capacity
*   Shadow testing:
    *   Mirror the traffic to both the versions
    *   Stubbing needs to be desigend as it may double process a payment (EG)

#### GKE
