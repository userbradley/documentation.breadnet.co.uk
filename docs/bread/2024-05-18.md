## Overall outcome

Bread was good, tried a new method where you put a frying pan in the oven so it's humid when it cooks, however:

* Bread was very doughy after baking

## Recipie followed

[Tesco fresh white loaf](https://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/fresh-white-loaf.html)

## Issues

## Bread was doughy

I did not let it proof for long enough and then when transferring it from the bowl to tin, I should let it raise again

## What to do differently next time

1. Let the dough raise for 1.5 hours
2. Transfer to baking tin
3. Let raise for 45 minutes
4. Cook
