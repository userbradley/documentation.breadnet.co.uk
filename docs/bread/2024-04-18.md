## Overall outcome

Bread tasted good, how ever there we some issues

* Bread did not fill the tin
* Bread was very doughy after baking

## Recipie followed

[Tesco fresh white loaf](https://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/fresh-white-loaf.html)

## Issues

## Bread did not fill the tin

I believe this was due to the dough rising in a different container, then being transferred to the making tub

## Bread was doughy

This I am putting down to 2 issues

1. The yeast did not have enough time do its thing
2. The oven was not hot enough when putting in the loaf


### The yeast did not have enough time do its thing

I am chalking this one up to the recipe being bad.

Searching around, lots of people are recompensing the below order of operations

1. 300ml of 30-35c water
2. Add sugar and yeast to water
3. stir and dissolve
4. add flour and salt to separate bowl
5. mix in oil to flour and salt bowl
6. add in water mix till doughy


### The oven was not hot enough when putting in the loaf

For the oven, I am thinking 250C start then slowly ramping the heat down may solve this: [source](https://thebakingnetwork.com/reasons-dense-dough/#:~:text=Oven%20and%20stone%20not%20hot%20enough.%20Your%20initial%20oven%20spring%20comes%20in%20the%20first%20ten%20minutes%20of%20baking.%20Many%20bakers%20are%20hesitant%20to%20pre%2Dheat%20thoroughly%20because%20of%20costs%2C%20but%20then%20the%20whole%20bake%20is%20a%20waste%20and%20disappointing%20because%20of%20poor%20oven%20spring%20and%20a%20dense%20loaf.)

## What to do differently next time

1. Mix yeast and sugar together with water before adding to dry ingredients
2. Kneading more gently
3. Allowing more time to rest
4. Knead again after the dough has rested
5. Hotter oven
6. Letting dough rest in baking tray
7. Wait for the dough to double in size
